## skycoin-armbian-nanopi-neo
Pre-configured Armbian image with DHCP enabled. Running Armbian_5.65_Nanopineo_Debian_stretch_next_4.14.78 with required repositories, a compatible version of Golang and the latest Skywire git pull. This exists because it took me a long time to get Go working on the Neo. I tried many images for similar boards with simsilar chips. This image came from Friendly Arm, who host both a Debian and Ubuntu based image for the Neo. Ubuntu was a giant turd, don't bother with it - for Skywire atleast. 

## Stuff
```
- Username: root
- Password: nanopineo
- armbian-config from the console to set your IP, set device name, locale.etc.
```

## Continue from here to finish off the system.
